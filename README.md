## Overview

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- HTML Forms


### What I learned

When the input is inside a label it is not necessary to use the *for=""*.

There are two **button types** submit and reset, if no type is set submit is the default setting.

Every page needs an **h1**, in this case because we switch to another card we have two h1 because there is always just one visible.

There is a **template HTML element** which is not rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.


### Continued development

I will use what I learn about JavaScript in the next challenges.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j12yejW6v1M&ab_channel=AndreasRemdt) - This helped me to implement JavaScript and do the CSS styling for the radio buttons.
